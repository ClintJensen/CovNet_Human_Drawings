- Talos 0.4.9
- scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn, pandas, numpy  

## Scripts/Files

**The following scripts are currently unable to be moved to CovNet folder**:  

- ```CovNet_VGG-19_Drawings_block5_pool_all.ipynb```
- ```CovNet_VGG-19_Drawings_block5_pool_kids.ipynb```
- ```hclustering_block5_layer_all_kids_257.ipynb```

## Usage
Run scripts locally by using **jupyter notebooks** or in the cloud with **google colab**
