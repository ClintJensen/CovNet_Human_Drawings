## Description  
Repo containing images of human drawings from children and adults
Here we use the VGG-19 ConvNet architecture with weights trained on ImageNet to extract features from intermediate layers. Such features are use to build and train a two deep-nets: (1) linear prediction of age; (2) binary classification of age (adult vs child)    
## Requirements
- Tensorflow 2.0
- Python 3.6
- Python libraries: Numpy, os, Scipy, matplotlib, Sklearn, Pandas, seaborn, pathlib, fancyimpute, rarfile
## How to use
Click into 'Colab' button at the top the Jupyter Notebook  
Or, use Python script with Tensorflow/Keras  
## Current state
Work in progress
