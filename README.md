## Description  
Repo containing images of human drawings from children  
Here we use the VGG-19 ConvNet architecture with weights trained on ImageNet to extract features from intermediate layers  
## Requirements
- Tensorflow 2.0
- Python 3.6
- Python libraries: Numpy, ss, Scipy, matplotlib, Sklearn, Pandas  
## How to use
Click into 'Colab' button at the top the Jupyter Notebook  
Or, use Python script with Tensorflow/Keras  
## Current state
Work in progress
