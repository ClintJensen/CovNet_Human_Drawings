## Description  
Repo containing images of human drawings from children  
Here we use the VGG-19 ConvNet architecture with weights trained on ImageNet to extract features from intermediate layers  
## Requirements
- Tensorflow 2.0
- Numpy
## How to use
Click into 'Colab' button at the top the Jupyter Notebook
## Current state
Work in progress
